There's no increament or decreament operator in Python.

Lists are mutable whereas Tuples aren't.

Tuples are faster than lists.

'pass' statement does nothing. Can be used when a statement is required. 

Find power y of a number x: x**y

Use dict() to create a new dictionary which is used as key-value pairs.
  Some important syntax:
    - check if a key is present in the dictionary- if 'xyz' in d
      where 'xyz' is a key in dict() 'd'
    - Delete a key- del d['xyz']
    - Iteration
      for i in d : 
        print "%s  %d" %(i, d[i])
      OR
      for index, key in enumerate(d): 
        print index, key, d[key]
